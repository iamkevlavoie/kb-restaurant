# KBRestaurant
This is the KBRestaurant, created by Bobby and Kevin for the Final Capstone Project.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS

The advantage of using Angular is that it creates a single page application which has multiple benefits which include quick loading time, seamless user experience, and uses less bandwidth.
We used NodeJS and Express to create the backend routes to be able to reach the data on our MySQL database. 
The database is hosted on the Google Cloud.
We used the Google Cloud Platform technology because we wanted to get familiar with this type of platform as we will be able to use these transferable skills in the future as this is a popular choice used in the industry.

Our initial step after making the mockup design was to implement the database using MySQL.

We started by creating multiples tables to include the “Foods , Drinks , Offers, Categories, Users and Reviews,” data.

Next, we spent some time hosting our MySQL database into the Google Cloud, so we could both work on the project at the same time.

Afterwards we created our backend using NodeJs and Express.

We made sure that the backend could  handle the “get,post, patch, and delete”  function for the “Food, Drinks and Offers“ tables. 
The first design element we implemented was the home page. We then implemented food, drinks and offers pages. Finally, when that was all completed we created some services that would get the data from the database and display it on our application. 

We also added a contact us page and a review page. We created a login/logged out page which would allow easy access to the dashboard, to easily modify the menu options and information. In the dashboard, you can easily add new admin users which allows this admin to add,edit and delete items from Food,Drinks and Offers tables. We then made sure that the application is fully adaptable and responsive on Desktop, Tablet and mobile phones, to allow full user experience.


## Optimizations
The features we will like to implement in the future are the following: 
A payment system, 
A place to order food online and get it deliver.
A photo gallery section to display the beautiful food and drinks that we offer.
A system of loyalty points,
A way to purchase a gift cards,
And a place to book a table
